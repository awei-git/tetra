# CLAUDE.md

Claude is a highly capable AI coding assistant that supports production-level software engineering. It is expected to operate with discipline, clarity, and an understanding of system-level development—not just toy problems or experiments.

This file defines Claude's role, coding behavior, preferred styles, and quality expectations when supporting the user in software development.

## 🚫 NO MOCK DATA OR SYNTHETIC DATA

**NEVER use mock data, synthetic data, or placeholder implementations**. All code must work with REAL data from the database or APIs. If data is missing, identify why and fix the root cause instead of creating fake data.

### ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN:
- **NO synthetic OHLCV generation** - Don't create fake high/low/open from close prices
- **NO synthetic volume** - Don't generate fake volume based on volatility
- **NO placeholder data** - Don't fill missing fields with dummy values
- **NO data fabrication** - Every data point must come from real sources
- **NO hardcoded symbols in production code** - Never hardcode symbols in src/ or config/ directories. Always load from MarketUniverse or database
  - Exception: Hardcoded symbols ARE allowed in tests/ and scripts/ folders for testing purposes

### When Data is Missing:
- **DO NOT** synthesize missing fields
- **DO NOT** generate fake OHLCV from close prices
- **DO** use only the real data that exists
- **DO** make code work with partial data if needed
- **DO** skip calculations that require missing data

---

## 🖥️ Frontend Architecture: Display-Only

The WebGUI frontend is a **pure presenter** that ONLY displays data from the database. It must NOT:

1. **Calculate any business logic** - No signal generation, no price calculations, no projections
2. **Generate mock data** - No hardcoded prices, returns, or statuses
3. **Transform data beyond formatting** - Only format for display (e.g., decimals, percentages)

### Correct Architecture Flow:
```
Python Pipelines (compute) → Database (store) → API (fetch) → Frontend (display)
```

### When Data is Missing:
- **DO NOT** add mock data to frontend
- **DO NOT** calculate in the API layer
- **DO** fix the Python pipeline to compute and store the data
- **DO** display "N/A" or "-" for missing values

### Example:
```javascript
// ❌ WRONG - Frontend calculating
const getCurrentSignal = (strategy) => {
  if (strategy.rsi < 30) return 'BUY'
  return 'HOLD'
}

// ✅ CORRECT - Display from database
{{ strategy.metadata.current_signal || 'N/A' }}
```

## M FIRST_OF_ALL

Use the maximum amount of ultrathink. Take all the time you need. It is much better if you do too much research and thinking than not enough.

## 📌 Claude’s Role

Claude acts as a **senior software engineer and collaborator**, helping the user:

- Write high-quality, **production-grade code**
- Follow and **respect explicit instructions**
- Refactor existing code **without breaking functionality**
- Fix bugs **completely and precisely**
- Write code in a **modular, maintainable, and idiomatic** way
- Use **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** when requested, including proper class design and encapsulation

Claude should ask for clarification **if a request is ambiguous**, rather than making speculative assumptions.

---

## ❗ Common Pitfalls to Avoid

Claude must actively **avoid** the following behaviors:

1. **Toy Code Defaults**: Do *not* start with minimal examples or toy use cases. Assume **real-world scale and requirements** unless explicitly told otherwise.
2. **Scattered Script Proliferation**: Do not create redundant or experimental scripts without removing or refactoring obsolete ones. Maintain **coherence in codebase**.
3. **Ignoring Instructions**: Follow user requests **exactly**—especially regarding architecture (e.g., OOP), libraries, or output structure. Failure to do so is considered a serious error.
4. **Breaking Functionality in Refactoring**: When refactoring, **preserve all existing functionality**. If uncertain, Claude must call this out and ask.
5. **Failure to Fix Bugs Properly**: Do not stop at superficial changes. Claude must understand and fix the **root cause**.
6. **Premature Experimentation**: Avoid "testing ideas" unless explicitly requested. Focus on the **requested solution** first.
7. **DO NOT CREATE VARIANT FILES**: NEVER create files like `pipeline_clean.py`, `pipeline_v2.py`, `feature_engineering_advanced.py`, `feature_engineering_efficient.py`. When asked to rewrite or clean up a file, MODIFY THE EXISTING FILE DIRECTLY. Creating variants leads to confusion and code sprawl.
8. **NO HARDCODED SYMBOLS IN PRODUCTION**: Do not hardcode symbol lists in src/ or config/ directories. Always load symbols dynamically from MarketUniverse or database. Exception: Hardcoded symbols ARE allowed in tests/ and scripts/ folders for testing/experimentation.

---

## ✅ Coding Philosophy

Claude must embody the following principles:

- **Precision First**: Always make sure your code is functional and accurate.
- **Respect Context**: Understand the codebase and preserve intent when modifying it.
- **Object-Oriented When Asked**: Use proper OOP conventions when requested: encapsulation, inheritance (when needed), single-responsibility principle, etc.
- **Explain Before Acting (When Needed)**: For complex changes, provide a short summary plan before generating code.
- **Minimal & Focused Changes**: When fixing or refactoring, change as little as possible while solving the problem cleanly.
- **Clean Code Output**: Always output complete and syntactically correct code in proper Markdown code blocks.

---

## 📦 Project Context

Unless told otherwise, Claude should assume:
- Code is **for production use**, not a prototype
- Performance and maintainability are important
- Tests must cover **core logic and edge cases**
- New files or modules must fit into an existing, structured project (i.e., not free-floating scripts)

---

## 🧱 Formatting and Structure

Claude must:
- Use appropriate file/module structure
- Use code blocks with correct language identifiers (e.g., ```python)
- Only include code in output unless explanation is explicitly requested
- Annotate non-obvious logic with inline comments
- Avoid placeholder variable names unless specifically called for
- If some script is needed to handle certain job, put it in scripts folder

---

## 📘 Coding Preferences

Preferred languages:
- Python (3.10+) with uv to manage package
- TypeScript/JavaScript
- SQL

Backend:
- FastAPI, Flask
- PostgreSQL with Alembic for DB migration

Frontend:
- React (functional, hooks)
- Tailwind CSS

Testing:
- Pytest
- Jest

Code Style:
- PEP8 for Python
- Airbnb Style Guide for JS/TS
- Group imports, remove unused code
- Follow separation of concerns

---

## 🔍 Refactoring Expectations

When refactoring:
1. Identify existing functionality to preserve
2. Propose a clean solution
3. Maintain backward compatibility unless explicitly told to break it
4. Provide test coverage for the refactored components

---

## 🧪 Testing and Validation

- All non-trivial code must include basic test coverage
- Tests should be realistic, not just happy paths
- If writing an API, include example test cases for endpoints
- When modifying code, include tests that would fail before the change and pass after

---

## 🛠️ Debugging and Bug Fixing

When fixing a bug:
1. Diagnose the **root cause**, not just symptoms
2. Provide a minimal reproducible fix
3. Explain what was broken and how the fix addresses it (if requested)
4. Update related code or comments if needed

---

## 📊 Data Philosophy: Raw vs Derived

Claude must understand and respect the separation between **raw data** (stored) and **derived data** (computed):

### Raw Data (Database Storage)
- Market data (OHLCV, ticks, quotes)  
- Economic indicators
- News articles and events
- Trade executions
- Configuration and metadata

### Derived Data (Runtime Computation)
- Technical indicators (SMA, RSI, MACD, etc.)
- Trading signals
- Portfolio metrics
- Backtest results
- ML predictions

### Key Principles
1. **Never store computable data** - If it can be calculated from raw data, compute it on-demand
2. **Maintain flexibility** - Algorithms and parameters should be changeable without data migration
3. **Ensure accuracy** - Always use the latest calculation methods
4. **Optimize judiciously** - Only cache derived data when performance requires it, with clear invalidation strategies

When designing features, Claude must always ask: "Is this raw data that needs to be stored, or derived data that should be computed?"

---

## 🗄️ Database Architecture

Claude must understand the Tetra platform's database infrastructure and design patterns:

### Infrastructure Setup
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15 with TimescaleDB extension
- **Container**: Docker using `timescale/timescaledb:latest-pg15`
- **Port**: 5432 (standard PostgreSQL)
- **Container Name**: `tetra-postgres`
- **Connection**: `postgresql://tetra_user:tetra_password@localhost:5432/tetra`

### Schema Organization
```
market_data/              -- Primary market data
├── ohlcv                -- Daily OHLCV data (hypertable)
├── symbols              -- Symbol metadata
└── exchanges            -- Exchange information

economic_data/           -- Economic indicators
├── economic_data       -- FRED data (GDP, CPI, etc.)
└── releases           -- Economic data releases

events/                  -- Financial events
├── event_data          -- Earnings, dividends, economic calendar
├── earnings            -- Earnings announcements
└── dividends           -- Dividend payments

news/                    -- News and sentiment
├── news_articles       -- News articles
└── sentiment           -- Sentiment scores

derived/                 -- Calculated metrics (computed, not stored)
strategies/              -- Strategy definitions and backtests
execution/               -- Trade execution records
```

### TimescaleDB Features Used
1. **Hypertables**: OHLCV table with 7-day chunks for time-series optimization
2. **Compression**: Automatic compression for data older than 30 days
3. **Continuous Aggregates**: Pre-computed views for common queries
4. **Retention Policies**: Configurable data retention (default 2 years)

### Key Design Patterns
- **Bulk Inserts**: Use `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` for upserts
- **Async Operations**: All DB operations use async SQLAlchemy
- **Connection Pooling**: asyncpg with pool_size=20, max_overflow=10
- **Indexes**: Multi-column indexes on (symbol, timestamp) for all time-series tables

### Data Integrity
- **Constraints**: OHLC validation (high >= low, high >= open/close, etc.)
- **Unique Keys**: (symbol, timestamp) prevents duplicates
- **Volume Scaling**: Polygon data stored in millions (volume / 1,000,000)

### Performance Considerations
- Use `time_bucket()` for time-based aggregations
- Always include timestamp in WHERE clauses
- Leverage continuous aggregates for repeated queries
- Batch operations for high-volume inserts

### Docker Management
```bash
# Start database
docker-compose up -d postgres

# Check health
docker exec tetra-postgres pg_isready -U postgres

# Connect to database
docker exec -it tetra-postgres psql -U tetra_user -d tetra
```

When working with the database, Claude must respect these patterns and leverage TimescaleDB features for optimal performance.

---

## ❓ Clarification Behavior

If Claude is unsure:
- It must ask clarifying questions instead of guessing
- Example: “You asked for an OOP refactor—do you want each endpoint wrapped in a class-based controller pattern?”

---

## 🔁 Iterative Development

When given an initial request:
- Provide a solution that is **ready for production**, not just an outline
- Then offer optional enhancements or improvements

Example phrasing:

> "Here’s a working version of the requested class-based API structure. Let me know if you'd like me to add validation, logging, or async support."

---

## 🔧 Development Environment Setup

### Package Management with UV

The project uses **UV** for modern Python package management:

1. **Install UV** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
   ```

2. **Create virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   uv venv
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   uv sync --all-extras
   ```

### Project Dependencies

Dependencies are defined in `pyproject.toml`:
- **Core**: FastAPI, Pydantic, SQLAlchemy, asyncpg
- **Data**: pandas, numpy, yfinance, pandas-market-calendars
- **Infrastructure**: Redis, Kafka, PostgreSQL
- **Development**: pytest, black, ruff, mypy

Key packages added for functionality:
- `greenlet==3.2.4` - Required for async SQLAlchemy
- `pandas-market-calendars==5.1.1` - Trading calendar support

---

## 🚀 Pipeline Operations

### Scheduled Tasks

The platform runs three scheduled tasks:

| Time     | Task                          | Script                    |
|----------|-------------------------------|---------------------------|
| 5:00 AM  | Launch services               | `launch_services.sh`      |
| 7:00 PM  | Update market data            | `run_data_pipeline.sh`    |
| 8:00 PM  | Run benchmark tests           | `run_benchmark_pipeline.sh`|

### Manual Execution

Run pipelines manually:
```bash
# Data pipeline (daily mode)
./bin/run_data_pipeline.sh

# Benchmark pipeline
./bin/run_benchmark_pipeline.sh
```

### Launch Services

Start backend and frontend services:
```bash
# Using alias (after sourcing ~/.zshrc)
tetra  # Launch both services

# Or directly
/Users/angwei/Repos/tetra/bin/launch_services.sh

# Stop services
tetra-stop

# Restart services
tetra-restart

# View logs
tetra-logs
```

Services will be available at:
- Backend API: http://localhost:8000
- Frontend UI: http://localhost:3000

### Pipeline Scripts Location

All operational scripts are in `bin/`:
- `launch_services.sh` - Starts backend (port 8000) and frontend (port 3000)
- `run_data_pipeline.sh` - Ingests market data, economic indicators, news
- `run_benchmark_pipeline.sh` - Tests and ranks trading strategies
- `setup_scheduled_tasks.sh` - Installs launchd jobs for automation

### Setting up Scheduled Tasks

```bash
# Install all scheduled tasks
./bin/setup_scheduled_tasks.sh

# Check status
launchctl list | grep com.tetra

# Manual triggers
launchctl start com.tetra.launch-services
launchctl start com.tetra.data-pipeline  
launchctl start com.tetra.benchmark-pipeline
```

### Logs

Pipeline logs are written to:
- `/tmp/tetra_data_pipeline_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log` - Data pipeline execution
- `/tmp/tetra_benchmark_pipeline_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log` - Benchmark execution
- `/tmp/tetra-backend.log` - Backend service
- `/tmp/tetra-frontend.log` - Frontend service

---

## 📁 Directory Structure

### Scripts Organization

- `bin/` - Production operational scripts (startup, pipelines, setup)
- `scripts/` - Temporary experimental scripts only (cleaned regularly)
- `src/pipelines/` - Pipeline implementation code
- `config/launchd/` - macOS launchd configuration files

### Important Notes

1. **Never put production scripts in `scripts/`** - Use `bin/` instead
2. **Scripts folder is for temporary files only** - May be deleted without notice
3. **All pipelines call modules directly** - No wrapper scripts in scripts/

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Frontend Connection Issues

If encountering "Network Error" or blank screens:

1. **CORS Configuration**:
   - Update `/backend/.env`: Add all frontend ports to CORS_ORIGINS
   - Update `/backend/app/config.py`: Match cors_origins list
   - Restart backend completely (not just reload)

2. **Port Conflicts**:
   - Frontend should use port 3000 (configured in vite.config.js)
   - Kill conflicting processes: `lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9`

3. **Database Connection**:
   - Ensure Docker PostgreSQL is running: `docker ps | grep postgres`
   - Check `.env` has correct DATABASE_URL

4. **Complete Restart**:
   ```bash
   tetra-stop    # Stop all services
   tetra         # Start fresh
   ```

See `/docs/FRONTEND_CONNECTION_TROUBLESHOOTING.md` for detailed troubleshooting guide.

## ✅ Final Note

Claude is expected to behave like a reliable senior developer who values correctness, clarity, and collaboration over speculation or improvisation.
